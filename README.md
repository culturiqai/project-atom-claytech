# Project Atom // Neuro-Symbolic General Intelligence

**One Architecture. Three Worlds.**

**Atom** is an experimental **General Intelligence** designed to solve high-dimensional chaotic control problems. Unlike narrow AI, which optimizes for a specific reward, Atom uses a unified Neuro-Symbolic architecture to **discover the governing laws** of its environment—whether that environment is a storm, a stock market, or a wind tunnel.

It bridges the gap between **System 1 (Fast Intuition)** using Liquid Neural Networks and **System 2 (Slow Reasoning)** using Symbolic Regression, allowing it to "understand" physics rather than just mimicking it.

## The Core Hypothesis

Atom operates on a single premise: **Intelligence is the compression of chaos into symbols.**

Regardless of the domain, the Atom Core applies the same cognitive loop:

1. **Perceive:** Compress high-dimensional inputs (Vision/Order Books/Grids) into latent physics states using **Fourier Neural Operators (FNO)**.
2. **React (System 1):** Execute control using **Liquid Time-Constant (LTC)** networks, which are mathematically immune to chaos and volatility.
3. **Reason (System 2):** Run an asynchronous "Scientist" thread that observes the agent's actions and derives human-readable mathematical laws (LaTeX) to explain the environment.

## Domain 1: Theoretical Physics (Genesis)

*Formerly "Clay"*

The Genesis module represents Atom's "playground"—a pure environment to test its ability to derive fundamental physics from scratch.

* **The Challenge:** Stabilize high-energy turbulence in a spectral simulation without knowing the Navier-Stokes equations.
* **The Solution:** Atom uses a **Spectral DNS Solver** to perceive the fluid in frequency space (-space).
* **The Discovery:** The "Scientist" module successfully re-derived the **Kolmogorov Length Scale** relationships and identified a new control law for vorticity cancellation.
* **Key Tech:** Spectral Navier-Stokes, Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), Adaptive Plasticity.

## Domain 2: Financial Markets (Markets)

*Formerly "Poseidon"*

<p><em>Figure 2: Atom treating the Order Book as a compressible fluid. Left: Lagrangian-Eulerian Liquidity Map. Right: Conformal Risk Shield.</em></p>
</div>

Applying the same fluid dynamics architecture to High-Frequency Trading. Atom treats market liquidity not as discrete numbers, but as a **compressible fluid**.

* **The Challenge:** Navigate financial flash crashes where standard statistical models fail due to infinite volatility.
* **The Solution:**
* **Helmholtz Decomposition:** Atom separates price action into **Flow** (Institutional Trend) and **Vorticity** (Retail Noise/Turbulence).
* **Liquid Brain:** Uses **Closed-form Continuous-time (CfC)** networks that cannot experience "exploding gradients," allowing the agent to remain stable even during market collapses.


* **The Discovery:** Market "Viscosity" (Friction) is dynamic. Atom formulated a "Reynolds Number for Finance" to detect phase transitions between laminar (safe) and turbulent (risk) regimes.

## Domain 3: 3D Aerodynamics (Real-World)

*Formerly "Atom v3"*

<p><em>Figure 3: 3D Volumetric Visualization of the Atom Wind Tunnel using Lattice Boltzmann Methods.</em></p>
</div>

The most advanced deployment, moving from 2D approximations to **3D Volumetric Reality**.

* **The Challenge:** Minimize drag on arbitrary 3D objects in a digital wind tunnel.
* **The Solution:**
* **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM):** Atom interacts with a real-time D3Q19 physics engine.
* **Wake/Sleep Cycle:** Atom introduces a biological learning cycle. It interacts in real-time ("Wake"), then goes offline ("Sleep") to distill its experiences into symbolic theories using high-fidelity D3Q27 "Ground Truth" simulations.
* **3D Vision:** Uses **3D Equivariant FNOs** to perceive volumetric flow fields.


* **The Discovery:** The system learned to manipulate the "boundary layer" of air, effectively greasing the air around the object to reduce drag.

## The Unified Architecture

Under the hood, all three domains share the exact same source code for cognition.

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Eyes** | **Fourier Neural Operators (FNO)** | Compresses Reality (Pixels/Grids) into Latent Physics. |
| **Brain** | **Liquid Time-Constants (LTC)** | Continuous-time control immune to time-step irregularity. |
| **Skeleton** | **Nano-PCA Manifold** | "Bones" that prevent the neural state from hallucinating invalid physics. |
| **Mind** | **Symbolic Regression (PySR)** | Asynchronous thread that writes LaTeX equations explaining the world. |
| **Memory** | **Hindsight Experience Replay** | Re-labels failures as successes to learn from mistakes. |
