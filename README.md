# Project Atom // Neuro-Symbolic General Intelligence

**One Architecture. Three Worlds.**

**Atom** is an experimental **General Intelligence** designed to solve high-dimensional chaotic control problems. Unlike narrow AI, which optimizes for a specific reward, Atom uses a unified Neuro-Symbolic architecture to **discover the governing laws** of its environment—whether that environment is a storm, a stock market, or a wind tunnel.

It bridges the gap between **System 1 (Fast Intuition)** using Liquid Neural Networks and **System 2 (Slow Reasoning)** using Symbolic Regression, allowing it to "understand" physics rather than just mimicking it.

## The Core Hypothesis

Atom operates on a single premise: **Intelligence is the compression of chaos into symbols.**

Regardless of the domain, the Atom Core applies the same cognitive loop:

1. **Perceive:** Compress high-dimensional inputs (Vision/Order Books/Grids) into latent physics states using **Fourier Neural Operators (FNO)**.
2. **React (System 1):** Execute control using **Liquid Time-Constant (LTC)** networks, which are mathematically immune to chaos and volatility.
3. **Reason (System 2):** Run an asynchronous "Scientist" thread that observes the agent's actions and derives human-readable mathematical laws (LaTeX) to explain the environment.

## Domain 1: Theoretical Physics (Genesis)

*Formerly "Clay"*

The Genesis module represents Atom's "playground"—a pure environment to test its ability to derive fundamental physics from scratch.

* **The Challenge:** Stabilize high-energy turbulence in a spectral simulation without knowing the Navier-Stokes equations.
* **The Solution:** Atom uses a **Spectral DNS Solver** to perceive the fluid in frequency space (-space).
* **The Discovery:** The "Scientist" module successfully re-derived the **Kolmogorov Length Scale** relationships and identified a new control law for vorticity cancellation.
* **Key Tech:** Spectral Navier-Stokes, Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), Adaptive Plasticity.

## Domain 2: Financial Markets (Markets)

*Formerly "Poseidon"*

<p><em>Figure 2: Atom treating the Order Book as a compressible fluid. Left: Lagrangian-Eulerian Liquidity Map. Right: Conformal Risk Shield.</em></p>
</div>

Applying the same fluid dynamics architecture to High-Frequency Trading. Atom treats market liquidity not as discrete numbers, but as a **compressible fluid**.

* **The Challenge:** Navigate financial flash crashes where standard statistical models fail due to infinite volatility.
* **The Solution:**
* **Helmholtz Decomposition:** Atom separates price action into **Flow** (Institutional Trend) and **Vorticity** (Retail Noise/Turbulence).
* **Liquid Brain:** Uses **Closed-form Continuous-time (CfC)** networks that cannot experience "exploding gradients," allowing the agent to remain stable even during market collapses.


* **The Discovery:** Market "Viscosity" (Friction) is dynamic. Atom formulated a "Reynolds Number for Finance" to detect phase transitions between laminar (safe) and turbulent (risk) regimes.

## Domain 3: 3D Aerodynamics (Real-World)

*Formerly "Atom v3"*

<p><em>Figure 3: 3D Volumetric Visualization of the Atom Wind Tunnel using Lattice Boltzmann Methods.</em></p>
</div>

The most advanced deployment, moving from 2D approximations to **3D Volumetric Reality**.

* **The Challenge:** Minimize drag on arbitrary 3D objects in a digital wind tunnel.
* **The Solution:**
* **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM):** Atom interacts with a real-time D3Q19 physics engine.
* **Wake/Sleep Cycle:** Atom introduces a biological learning cycle. It interacts in real-time ("Wake"), then goes offline ("Sleep") to distill its experiences into symbolic theories using high-fidelity D3Q27 "Ground Truth" simulations.
* **3D Vision:** Uses **3D Equivariant FNOs** to perceive volumetric flow fields.


* **The Discovery:** The system learned to manipulate the "boundary layer" of air, effectively greasing the air around the object to reduce drag.

##cDomain 4: Quantum Cosmology (PROBE-LIV)

The Frontier: Hunting for the Pixelation of Spacetime.

<p><em>Figure 4: Atom's Scientist module successfully "focusing" a Blazar flare by subtracting the energy-dependent time lag caused by discrete spacetime.</em></p>
</div>

In this domain, Atom functions as a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) engine to test for Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV)—the theory that the speed of light is not constant at the Planck scale.

The Challenge: High-energy photons from distant Blazars should arrive "late" if spacetime is discrete. However, intrinsic turbulence in the source also causes delays. Current physics cannot distinguish between "Source Noise" and "Quantum Gravity Signal"

The Atom Solution:
- Teacher (Simulation): Atom trains on $10^6$ relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of Blazar jets to learn the manifold of "physically valid" flares
- Student (Liquid Brain): The Neural Skeleton learns to model the chaotic evolution of the jet. When analyzing real telescope data (CTA/Fermi), it treats the QG delay as an "anomaly" or "stress" that deviates from the learned physics.
- Scientist (Symbolic): It effectively "derotates" the dispersion to minimize entropy, discovering the lag law:$$\Delta t = \alpha \cdot E \cdot z + \beta_{\text{intrinsic}}$$

The Validation: In Proof-of-Concept simulations, Atom successfully recovered the Quantum Gravity Scale ($E_{QG}$) by statistically minimizing the "blur" of the photon arrival times, turning the universe into a focused lens.

## The Unified Architecture

Under the hood, all three domains share the exact same source code for cognition.

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Eyes** | **Fourier Neural Operators (FNO)** | Compresses Reality (Pixels/Grids) into Latent Physics. |
| **Brain** | **Liquid Time-Constants (LTC)** | Continuous-time control immune to time-step irregularity. |
| **Skeleton** | **Nano-PCA Manifold** | "Bones" that prevent the neural state from hallucinating invalid physics. |
| **Mind** | **Symbolic Regression (PySR)** | Asynchronous thread that writes LaTeX equations explaining the world. |
| **Memory** | **Hindsight Experience Replay** | Re-labels failures as successes to learn from mistakes. |
